      <h3>Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification Dataset</h3>
      <p>
        Since real predictive maintenance datasets are generally difficult to obtain and in particular difficult to publish, we present and provide a synthetic dataset that reflects real predictive maintenance encountered in the industry to the best of our knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>The dataset consists of 10,000 data points stored as rows with 7 features in columns:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Type: consisting of a letter L, M, or H for low (50% of all products), medium (30%), and high (20%) as product quality variants and a variant-specific serial number</li>
        <li>Air Temperature [K]: generated using a random walk process later normalized to a standard deviation of 2 K around 300 K</li>
        <li>Process Temperature [K]: generated using a random walk process normalized to a standard deviation of 1 K, added to the air temperature plus 10 K</li>
        <li>Rotational Speed [rpm]: calculated from power of 2860 W, overlaid with a normally distributed noise</li>
        <li>Torque [Nm]: torque values are normally distributed around 40 Nm with an Ïƒ = 10 Nm and no negative values</li>
        <li>Tool Wear [min]: The quality variants H/M/L add 5/3/2 minutes of tool wear to the used tool in the process</li>
        <li>Machine Failure: label that indicates whether the machine has failed in this particular data point for any of the following failure modes are true</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Target: Failure or Not</li>
      </ul>
